We are the product of all the past experiences of the lineage that came before us. All the mistakes, triumphs, and even the mundane moments that we even find ourselves in from time to time. Those all had influence on us in one way or another and the amazing thing is— we are here. We are living in a time where barriers and limits are being pushed and broken more than ever. We were born to make change, to test the status quo, to live up to the countless dreams and aspirations that came before us. We were born to forge our own path, to learn, and to grow. <strong>We are all born with the potential to accomplish anything and that’s what makes us GREAT</strong>.\n\n<em>nanos gigantum humeris insidentes</em>&nbsp; - <em>we stand on the shoulders of giants</em>\n\nWe have access to wisdom that spans until what seems like the inception of humanity. In the age we live in, all this information is available to us after a few taps into a search engine. We are born with the opportunity to grow from the wisdom from those who came before us, master that wisdom, and push its boundaries. Børn Great aims to connect thinkers and creatives so that we can push the boundaries together and <strong>aspire to inspire </strong>the next generation. We aim to serve as a shoulder to stand on, an experience to learn from, as wisdom to pass on. Here <strong>we</strong> project <strong>our</strong> passions and clue our readers in to what inspires&nbsp;<strong>us</strong> in this crazy world.

I was expecting another struggle to get through the work day from one podcast episode to the next while filling out unemployment briefs and bankruptcy claims. When I walked in, two of our lead attorneys were angrily yelling. Not at each other, but at something. When I asked what they were angry about, they just replied with, \"We\'re going to Pahrump.\" To be honest, I didn\'t fucking want to drive two hours, but I thought it\'d be more interesting than to stay inside all day. To give you an idea of the visiting Pahrump, the Mayor owns a chain of brothels and calls himself the \"Trump of Pahrump, but it\'s just easier to call him a piece of shit. During the drive, our attorney Haley explained that the reason warranting the two-hour was because the local Nye County Sheriff\'s Deputies raided a local homeless encampment call \"the Hill\" consisting of around 40-50 people in abandoned land. As expected, it is located up a desert dirt hill hosting a circle of RV\'s, tents, cars, and trailers. Nevada Legal was not particularly made for this kind of thing, but no one else was going to do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The camp itself is around seven to eight years old, but this was not their first time being moved out of land. Five years ago, the camp was threatened to be bulldozed by developers, but the then residents were just warned to move further away into the desert. The land was believed to be owned by the Bureau of Land Management, which is an agency that handles and auctions land on the behalf of the federal government. It\'s pretty common practice for people to squat on this kind of land, especially in Nevada where most of it is unsold or underdeveloped outside of the major cities. After the initial incident five years ago, there has not been a single warning or notice, but that changed when the owner finally visited his property. According to an officer, the landowner almost threw up at the sight of the camp. He dialed 911 shortly after. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before the incident, Nye County Police have been through the camp before, but mostly to find certain persons of interests. In some incidents, the residents themselves have even called police to handle domestic disputes. No officer ever mentioned trespassing before. Today was different. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The actual eviction took place on September 12, 2018. Residents vary on the time, but most believe it occurred around 10:00 AM. Nye County Sheriffs Deputies rolled into the camp with five marked police cars blaring sirens to the surprise of most residents. Some were still sleeping, but most were awakened by the aggressive verbal and physical warnings to leave within 15 minutes or risk being arrested for trespassing. The Police made sure that every resident was awakened and removed. Their belongings are still up there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The residents I met are not easy to generalize. Granted, they were all white, but they came from everywhere. Some were living around the Nye County area for years before finding this community. One woman is from Wisconsin fleeing from an abusive domestic violence situation. A young but wilting couple were from Hurricane Harvey trying to find a place with no hurricanes. They had lost everything just a month prior, and an older Hill resident gave the unlucky couple her trailer to live in before passing on. One older resident is a veteran whose insufficient VA checks could never cover rent in any of the surrounding areas. Some admitted mental health issues that prevented working. Most residents just came across bad luck in life, but all were grateful for The Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the eyes of some, the Hill has granted some unparalleled access to society\'s most vulnerable including a local domestic violence shelter, a local Pahrump church, homeless coalitions, and nonprofits. Churches often come up to give clothes, food, water, and other necessities. Drug use does occur in \"the Hill,\" but only within private confines. The only real issue might be when someone gets a little too drunk, but I don\'t think that\'s an income-exclusive problem. Even in facing eviction, groups within the Hill are trying to stay together to pool resources and figure out their next steps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One story demonstrating the importance of this community was from the lady from Wisconsin. While her current non-abusive husband was away for work, two visitors passing through the camp choked and raped her. When word spread about the incident, members of the camp armed themselves and walked these two out of the camp and down the hill. Women and men were separating her from the rapists all along the road to ensure their departure. After that incident, the young lady from Wisconsin sees the community as family. At the time of our interview, she recently discovered brain cancer tragically to accompany her 7-month pregnancy, and the Hill is the only thing holding her together. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The community is now scattered drifting between couches, hiding in other abandoned lots, or still trying to find their next option. Most residents just didn\'t have enough time to grab everything. Trailers and RVs full of personal belongings like priceless guitars, solar panels, and perishable foods are still up there sparsely patrolled by police. Everyone I talked to just wants more time to grab their things and in some cases, their homes. Granted, the residents were trespassing on land, but this is from the conditions that we have created as a society. We have ignored our most vulnerable peoples of veterans, natural disaster survivors, and those suffering physical and mental illnesses. For creating their own opportunity in the face of misfortune, we punish them with inhumane treatment that none of us would ever have to face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In Nevada, a landlord is required to deliver a \"Five-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit\" to the tenant. If there is no lease agreement, Nevada law requires a thirty-day \"no cause\" notice for the tenant to leave. For whatever crimes the Hill residents may have committed, our tax dollars, elected politicians, and reinforced values all perpetuate the very conditions to those that least deserve it. If they are guilty, we are as well. We punish the victims when they create solutions to the problems that we do not want to solve. What I would advocate for is a humane alternative for the Hill residents to transition into. At the time of this posting, Pahrump does not have a homeless shelter, and the closest Las Vegas shelters are always overcrowded. At the very least, the Hill residents should be given a humane amount of time to move their belongings that anyone else would receive. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Khailil Gibran famously wrote:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;<br>And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Edit: Nye County listened to their stories, but despite all efforts, the residents were ultimately evicted.

Sessue Hayakawa was an American movie star from the early 1900\'s that often played an exotic lover in lead roles. In his breakout film&nbsp;<em>The Cheat</em>, Hayakawa plays Haka Arakua, a wealthy man that helps maintain an expensive lifestyle for an affluent couple when much of their fortune becomes inaccessible. In exchange for his money, Hayakawa\'s character asks for the wife\'s (played by Fannie Ward) companionship and compliance with strange fetishes. Arakua does some wild shit: in one scene, he brands this white woman\'s back with a searing hot iron. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Cheat</em>, Sessue Hayakawa essentially cucks a white man (Jack Dean), but Hayakawa would be the one to get fucked over the rest of his career. Sessue Hayakawa became typecasted into an exotic lover or sinister villain that would drive the main female role towards the hands of the white male lead. At the same time, Hayakawa\'s rare racial difference would cast him as various non-Japanese roles including an Indian rebel leader, an Arab donkey Shepard, a Native-American, and a Chinese Tong Warrior. In&nbsp;<em>The Cheat</em>, the studio changed the credits of Hayakawa\'s character into a Burmese Ivory trader.
